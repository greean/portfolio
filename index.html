      <h3>Why I joined Code Nation</h3>
      <p>
          I've worked in local government maintaining websites for the last 15 years. During that time my role was slowly being moved away from the actual designing and development of new sites to just updating the content, as well as many other non-related tasks. When the rounds of redundancies kept coming, I finally made up my mind that I needed to move on and decided that I wanted to get into software development as I'd really enjoyed the coding aspect in my early career. Since taking redundancy I've tried to teach myself a few coding languages such as javascript, python and C#. However, my progress was slow, so I began to look into coding bootcamps. I liked the look of Code Nation as there was a campus not far from me in Chester. After looking through the website, weighing up the cost of the course against the time it would take me if I continued trying to teach myself, I dicided that Code Nation would speed up my progress and help me get in to a software development role. </p>
      <h3>Week 1 Targets</h3>
      <p>
          The first week at Code Nation was an intro to Javascript. I really enjoyed this and was able to pretty much understand and keep up with the content of the course. The main challenge was to keep on top of the huge amount of challenges being set. After a few late nights during the first few days I feel fairly confident with all the topics covered, though I've still got some of the challenges to do when I find the time to go back to them!
